            "text": "Your utilization is the percentage of your total credit limit that you are currently using. For example, if you have a $1,000 limit and owe $300, your utilization is 30%. In Canada, this factor alone accounts for a massive 30% of your total credit score calculation."

            "text": "Lenders see high utilization as a red flag that you might be overextended or relying too much on credit. Even if you pay your bill in full every month, if your 'statement balance' is constantly near your limit, your score will drop. Keeping it under 30% signals you are a low-risk borrower."
